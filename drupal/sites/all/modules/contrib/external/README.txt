This extremely simple module opens all links to external sites in new tabs. It uses jQuery instead of target=_blank so the markup will still validate.

It's preferred over the great http://drupal.org/project/extlinks module for cases when you either only need this one feature (since this module is much more lean) or it is important that the generated (i.e., dynamically by JavaScript) markup still validate.

Installation:
  * Download and enable the module
  * ...
  * Profit! You're done! There's no configuration page necessary.
